# AI-Driven Human Pose Tracking & Visualization

## Project Description
This project combines **Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision** to visualize dance movements using **MediaPipe Pose Detection** and **OpenCV**. It tracks human body poses from a dance video and generates a glowing, mirrored skeleton animation with dynamic color effects, transforming dance motion into creative visual art.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to demonstrate how AI and Computer Vision can be used beyond traditional analytics for **creative expression**. By blending pose estimation with visual effects, the project highlights how technology can convert human motion into interactive and artistic digital experiences.

## How It Works
The input dance video is processed frame-by-frame using OpenCV. MediaPipe Pose Detection extracts key body landmarks, which are then connected to form a skeletal structure. The skeleton is mirrored, enhanced with glow effects, and rendered with dynamic color changes to create visually engaging animations.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV  
- **Pose Detection:** MediaPipe  
- **Numerical Processing:** NumPy  

## Key Features
- Real-time pose detection using MediaPipe  
- Skeleton-based dance visualization  
- Mirrored dancer effect  
- Glowing skeleton animation  
- Dynamic color-changing effects  
- Frame-by-frame rendering using OpenCV  
- Creative fusion of AI and visual art  

## Use Cases
- Dance analysis and visualization  
- Creative coding and digital art  
- AI-based motion visualization  
- Educational demonstrations for pose detection  
- Entertainment and social media content creation  

## Outcome
The final output is a visually captivating glowing skeleton dance video that mirrors the original dancer’s movements. The project successfully demonstrates accurate pose detection combined with smooth and aesthetically pleasing animations.

## Future Scope
- Real-time webcam-based dance tracking  
- Multi-person pose detection  
- Beat-synced color and effect changes  
- Integration with music rhythm analysis  
- Deployment as an interactive application
