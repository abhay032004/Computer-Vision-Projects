# Real-Time Hand Tracking & Finger Counting Using MediaPipe and OpenCV

## Project Description
This project is a real-time computer vision system developed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It detects hands from a live webcam feed and accurately counts the number of raised fingers. The system supports both hands, includes intelligent thumb detection based on hand orientation, and records the output video with visual overlays.

## Project Vision
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of real-time hand gesture analysis using AI and computer vision. It lays the foundation for advanced gesture-based interaction systems and contactless user interfaces.

Potential application areas include:
- Gesture-based user interfaces  
- Sign language recognition systems  
- Game control using hand gestures  
- Contactless human-computer interaction  
- Smart home automation using gestures  

## Key Features
- Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe Hands  
- Accurate finger counting for all five fingers  
- Intelligent thumb detection based on left and right hand orientation  
- Live webcam video processing using OpenCV  
- Support for multi-hand tracking (up to two hands)  
- Output video recording in `.mp4` format with visual overlays  
- Modular and extensible design for gesture-controlled applications  

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries: OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy  

## Outcome
The system reliably detects hands and counts raised fingers in real time with good accuracy and performance. It demonstrates an effective combination of AI-based hand tracking and traditional computer vision techniques.
