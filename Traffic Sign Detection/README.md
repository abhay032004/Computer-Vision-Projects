# Traffic Sign Detection Using YOLOv8

## Project Description
This project implements a **Traffic Sign Detection system** using the YOLOv8 object detection model. A pre-trained dataset sourced from **Roboflow** is used to train and evaluate the model. The system is capable of detecting multiple traffic sign classes in images and videos, enabling real-time and accurate traffic sign recognition.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset is obtained from **Roboflow** and consists of labeled traffic sign images with bounding box annotations. It includes multiple traffic sign categories under different lighting and environmental conditions, making the model robust for real-world scenarios.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to develop an AI-based traffic sign detection system that can assist **advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)** and autonomous driving applications by accurately identifying road signs in real time.
